The main character is wearing a red and gold outfit with a crown, which makes me think they might be royalty or part of some elite group. The background is dark with a red wall that has "Just B Club" written in white. That name sounds like it could be a club or a gang, maybe something exclusive.

The overall theme is red and black with a futuristic vibe. I should check what the screens are showing. If I can read the text on them, that might give clues about available actions.
